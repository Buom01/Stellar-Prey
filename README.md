# Stellar-Prey
GrangerHub's STELLAR PREY™ game is a first person strategy shooter that chronicles the conflict between human technology vs extraterrestrial nature, a conflict waged by construction, team coordination, and epic combat.  Help shape the course of your species together towards the top of the stellar food chain, or be the prey together on the road towards extinction.  Which path will you and your species choose to take?  It's a universal tale of survival vs death, and of order vs chaos, as old as life itself.
